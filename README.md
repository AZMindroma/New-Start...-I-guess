# Unity-CubePush
Simple and very incomplete Unity "game". The goal is to push cubes on their respective pressure plates. The plan was to add more levels, but I got stuck trying to add proper obstacles. 

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to PR. But I still have to figure the Unity version of this out lol
